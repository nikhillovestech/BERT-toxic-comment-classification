# BERT-toxic-comment-classification
Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification using Google's BERT
I use Google BERT(Uncased-12 Layers) Small Model for Text Classification.
BERT is pretrained on large wikipedia corpus data.
I initialize BERT Layers using the checkpoint file except the output_layer.
I trained the model for 13000 steps and it shows promising results.
